\section{(Introduction)}

\subsection{Purpose}
The primary objective of the Aerolyzer project is to create a tool that infers local air quality using regional weather data and aerosol analysis. To accomplish this goal, the Aerolyzer project requires a Python library that identifies images relevant to aerosols, analyzes acceptable images for aerosol content, stores relevant information for trend analysis, and compiles weather information with its aerosol data.

\subsection{Scope}
A front-end UI has already been developed, but must be modified in order to become a useful too. Bringing this library's functionality to a mainstream audience calls for an open-source back-end Python API to perform image analysis. This front end UI shall present the Aerolyzer library's weather and air quality inference based on analyzed images or by a requested location. The UI shall also collect user-submitted cell phone images of the horizon, sunset, and sunrise to be fed to the library for analysis. The Aerolyzer project shall exclusively serve users in the United States.

\subsection{Definitions}
Aerosol: Small particles suspended in the atmosphere. One can visibly see the effects of aerosols in the 'Rayleigh scattering effect' which visibly reddens sunsets and sunrises. \\

Acceptable image: An acceptable image is defined as an unedited image of the horizon, sunset, or sunrise.\\

Horizon: The horizon is defined as the line at which the sky and earth's surface appear to meet.\\

Sunrise: A sunrise is defined as the colors and light visible in the sky produced by the sun's first appearance in the morning.\\

Sunset: A sunset is defined as the colors and light visible in the sky produced when the sun disappears in the evening.\\
