\begin{abstract} 
Atmospheric aerosols are particles suspended in the atmosphere. These particles originate from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions, and unnatural sources such fossil fuels combustion. One can visibly see the effects of aerosols in the 'Rayleigh scattering effect' of sunlight which visibly reddens sunsets and sunrises.

\section{Problem Definition}
Monitoring atmospheric aerosols is important; high concentrations directly and indirectly impact the atmosphere's air quality, chemical composition, and radiation distribution. Unfortunately, aerosols in the atmosphere are constantly changing, and current tools such as satellite, aircraft, and ground-based instruments do not compile data into language easily understandable by the average person. Currently, there is no way to judge local air quality using regional aerosol data without in-depth atmospheric knowledge. Additionally, delayed or inaccurate atmospheric reports complicate getting reliable local atmospheric information. 

\section{Proposed Solution}
The Aerolyzer project aims to estimate local air quality using regional weather data and aerosol analysis for users in the United States. This can be accomplished by crowd-sourcing cell phone images of the horizon, sunsets, and sunrises into a central database for analysis. The primary objective of this project is to create a python library that extracts location data from images and analyzes said images for aerosol content. The secondary goal of the Aerolyzer project is to develop an application that collects images from users and delivers the python library in an intuitive web-based UI. 
\par
The Aerolyzer web application has been partially developed and will be expanded to present two options to the user: contribute to the Aerolyzer project by uploading their image of the horizon, or look up local air quality by zip code. The Aerolyzer project will only serve users in the United States. The Aerolyzer server-sided python library shall use a classification algorithm to filter out images that do not contain the horizon during sunrises or sunsets. Acceptable images shall be stored and categorized in a database for analysis. The library shall be able to perform an analysis on relevant images in its database based on date, location, and 3rd party APIs. The library shall be able to identify sunrises, sunsets, the horizon, and atmospheric phenomena within degrees of certainty.

\section{Performance Metrics} 
When completed, this library shall identify horizons in a test-selection of images with a minimum accuracy of 50\% certainty. Images of horizons that contain sunsets and sunrises shall be identified with a minimum of 50\% certainty. This certainty shall be verifiable through a series of regression tests to prove the accuracy of horizon detection. 
\par
The horizon is defined as the line at which the sky and earth's surface appear to meet. A sunrise is defined as the colors and light visible in the sky produced by the sun's first appearance in the morning. A sunset is defined as the colors and light visible in the sky produced when the sun disappears in the evening.
\par
The library shall be able to provide general weather data amassed from public API regardless of whether the user provides an image or their zip code. The library  shall be capable of performing color analysis on images that have been classified as sunrises or sunsets to estimate aerosol content. Based on this color analysis, the application shall be able to display the aerosol that most likely caused the scattering of different hues. 
\par
To standardize development between different computers and operating systems, a virtual-machine development environment shall be created. This environment shall contain the libraries and tools necessary to run the Aerolyzer Python library as a stand-alone program as well as  verify the aforementioned classifier certainty regression tests.
