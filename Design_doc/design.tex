\section{Overview}
	\subsection{Scope}
		Aerolyzer mobile web application is intended to retrieve data from user images in order to analyze colors in the images using Wunderground data and image analysis software. This application proposed by Kim Whitehall is intended for aiding in the public understanding of air quality and of aerosols in the atmosphere. 
	\subsection{Purpose}
		This document describes the three main components of Aerolyzer that will be designed, those being the library data interface, the horizon detection filter and the library structure. 
	\subsection{Intended Audience}
		The intended audience for this software design document is the Aerolyzer developers and clients. It will serve to set design intentions so that the client can confirm the design plan will meet the requirements.

\section{Definitions}
	
	\subsection{Aerosol}\label{def:aerosol}
		Aerosols are tiny particles dispersed throughout the atmosphere.
		These particles originate from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions, and unnatural sources such as pollution. 
		One can visibly see the effects of aerosols in the 'Rayleigh scattering effect'  which visibly reddens sunsets and sunrises. \cite{allen_2015}
	
	\subsection{Acceptable Image}\label{def:accImg}
		An acceptable image is defined as an unedited image of the horizon. \ref{def:horizon}
		Images used in data collection must have valid EXIF meta data, while the images used in training classifiers only require relevant image content. \ref{def:exif}
	
	\subsection{Horizon}\label{def:horizon}
		The horizon is defined as the line at which the sky and earth's surface appear to meet.
	
	\subsection{EXIF}\label{def:exif}
		Exchangeable image file format.
	
	\subsection{Local}\label{def:local}
		Local is defined as the circular area around an observer with the radius being the distance from an observer's position to the horizon.
		For an observer on the ground, this distance is approximately 2.9 miles (4.7 km) and for an observer standing at an elevation of 100 ft (30 m) above ground level this distance is approximately 12.2 miles (19.6 km).

        \subsubsection{Horizon Detection Filter}
        The Aerolyzer library hopes to feature a module that infers aerosol size based on the hue distribution in images of the sunrise or sunset. To this end, a filter that intelligently recognizes acceptable images \ref{def:accImg} is necessary to save computation time and guarantee reliable data.
        \subsubsection{Library Structure}
        The Aerolyzer library aims to be accessible to import for scientific research purposes. The structure of this library will determine the ease of access of this library.
	\subsection{Identified design stakeholders}
    	\subsubsection{Image Data Preprocessing}
        
        \subsubsection{Horizon Detection Filter}
        The stakeholders for the Horizon Detection Filter python module include users who will be using the Aerolyzer web service. Users will ideally not have to wait for long periods of time for the server to process weather and air quality analysis. The horizon filter will expedite this process by filtering out bad data.
        \subsubsection{Library Structure}
        The stakeholders for the Aerolyzer library’s structure will be the developers and the Aerolyzer’s primary stakeholder, Dr. Kim Whitehall. The Dr. Whitehall requires the library to be accessible from Python’s package index.

          Smartphone images all store EXIF data when the image is created. This data varies from device to device as EXIF data isn't entirely standardized, but there are certain tags that the Aerolyzer library will require the image has.

	\subsection{Horizon Detection Filter}
      \subsubsection{Design Elements - OpenCV }
      		\paragraph{Design Attributes}
          		Outlined in the Software Design Document, a horizon detection filter shall be created using OpenCV and other python libraries as required. OpenCV is a BSD-licensed computer-vision library with many relevant sub-modules. Containing over 2,500 algorithms, OpenCV can analyze images and videos, recognize faces, identify objects, perform visual transformations, and more. One can use image transformations to normalize image data such that a classifier can more easily distinguish what is in a given image. \cite{svm}

				As of December 2017, Kin-Ho Lam has designed and tested two horizon detection classifiers using OpenCV 3.3.0. Ongoing work on the project can be viewed in the Aerolyzer library’s open-source Github. These classifiers are horizon detection by straight line and horizon detection by color threshold.

          \paragraph{Design Relationships}
					.\\
					\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=1907,natheight=787]{images/Design2.png}

          \paragraph{Design Constraints}
          		Aerolyzer’s unique image criterion necessitates a predictive data model capable of detecting horizons with a minimum of 66\% certainty and identifying aersols with a minimum of 50\% certainty. Efficient and expedient algorithm performance is necessary due to the expected user base who will be waiting for Aerolyzer to service their request. Pending further research, these criterion are achievable through OpenCV though more computer vision libraries or modules may be required.
      
      \subsubsection{Design overlays}
      		\paragraph{OpenCV Horizon Detection by Straight Line Algorithm}
      			Horizon detection by straight line seeks to detect the simplest possible acceptable image; a picture of the sunset/sunrise without obstructions. In this case, one can expect the most visible longest and straightest line in an image to be the horizon. With this assumption, the Horizon Detection by Straight Line algorithm shall accept or reject an image through the following procedure:
      			\begin{enumerate}
      				\item Upon receiving an image, detect the longest and straightest line.
      				\item If there is no straight line stretching across the image, reject it.
      			\end{enumerate}
      			As a proof of concept, the algorithm is implemented in the following python function. This algorithm draws a straight green line where it believes the horizon is.
      			\lstinputlisting[language=Python,basicstyle=small]{code/HorizonDetectionbyStraightLine.py}
     			
     			Upon being fed an image, the Horizon Detection by Straight Line’s algorithm works as follows:
				

				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Perform a gaussian blur on the image
					\item Convert the image to grayscale
					\item Perform Canny Edge Detection \cite{svm}
					\item Perform Hough Line Transformation \cite{svm}
					\item If there is a straight line, draw a green line spanning across the image. This is the classified horizon.
					\item Else, if there are no straight lines, then reject the image.
				\end{enumerate}


				This approach works well for some images such as fig X pulled from the Aerolyzer test image album. However, it is clear that this approach does not work for all cases, as seen in fig Y, detecting the horizon by straight line fails in images with a complex foreground that contains many straight lines. A new algorithm is necessary to enhance detection accuracy.

				\\
 				\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/line2.jpg}

				\paragraph{OpenCV Horizon Detection by Threshold}
					Horizon Detection by Threshold is a more versatile method compared to straight line detection because it relies on segmenting color distribution. Detection by Threshold was designed to classify images that contain complex foregrounds by distinguishing what part of the image is the sky. The Threshold algorithm shall accept or reject an image through the following procedure:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Separate the image by distinct color spaces
						\item Perform a binary threshold with the minimum color threshold being the color of the sky.
						\item Calculate the area of the largest continuous contour that is within the sky color threshold.
						\item Apply a statistical function to ratio the area of sky color over the total area of the image to produce a confidence rating. A high confidence rating shall indicate that the image contains a horizon while a low confidence rating indicates there is no horizon.
					\end{enumerate}

					As a proof of concept, the algorithm is implemented in the following python function. This algorithm draws a green outline of what it believes to be the sky.

					\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{code/HorizonDetectionbyThreshold.py}

					Upon being fed an image, (this example features Fig. Y) the Horizon Detection by Threshold works as follows:
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Convert image into converted to TCbCr digital color space (not to be confused with YUV colorspace).\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/1.jpg}
						\item A TCbCr digital color space separates the pictures intensity from its colors, enabling a histogram equalization on the blue channel. After performing this equalization, the red-green-blue channels are merged back together. This enables a separation of the sky and clouds from the foreground.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/2.jpg}
						\item This separation of sky and foreground becomes clearer after the image is converted back to BGR.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/3.jpg}
						\item Prepare to segment the sky from the foreground by greyscaling the image and applying a gaussian blur.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/3.jpg}
						\item Apply a binary threshold; if a pixel value is at least 120, it is assigned grey otherwise it is assigned a black value.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/4.jpg}
						\item Erode the image to de-noise and improve clarity.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/5.jpg}
						\item Finish de-noise with a dialite to de-chunk the image.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/6.jpg}
						\item Draw contours, in this case it visually appears as a white outline around the largest continuous grey section.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/7.jpg}
						\item If contours can be drawn, then the largest contour is overlaid on the original image. Fig. Y “passes” as acceptable and as see it accurately outlines the visible sky.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/8.jpg}
						\item If no contours can be drawn, the algorithm fails the image, meaning no sky or horizon can be detected.\\
							\includegraphics[width=4.5in,natwidth=640,natheight=480]{images/threshold/9.jpg}
					\end{enumerate}
					This algorithm struggles to classify low-light images, improvements and fine-tuning are necessary. One can see the threshold algorithm works well for fig. Y.

      \subsubsection{Design Rationale}
      	The Aerolyzer Horizon Detection Filter needs to identify acceptable images, namely ones of the sunset or sunrise. Research indicates that specific sunset or sunrise image classification  necessitates a predictive Tensorflow model because creating such an unsupervised classifier in OpenCV is a challenging task. As demonstrated in Fig. Z, this design rationale is accomplished by incorporating a trained Tensorflow model as a secondary step after OpenCV Horizon Detection by Threshold. Tensorflow analysis is a computationally expensive process. An OpenCV classifier to detect the presence of the sky saves computation time by rejecting all images that do not have skies. If no sky is present then it logically follows that there can be no sunrise or sunset in the image.

      \subsubsection{Design languages}
      	An element in the greater Aerolizer python library, the horizon detection algorithm shall be written in Python 2.7.12 while importing OpenCV 3.3.0 and Numpy 1.13.3. The Aerolyzer project’s sponsor, Dr. Whitehall, chose Python as the library’s primary language. 

	\subsection{Library Structure}\label{des:LibStructure}
      \subsubsection{Design Elements}
          \paragraph{Design Attributes}
                    One goal of Aerolyzer is to create an accessible python package capable of being imported and giving access to all of the horizon detecting and color analyzing software written when creating a functioning Aerolyzer mobile web application. This will include an Apache licensed python script setup.py that ensures required packages such as numpy 1.8.0, exifread, opencv-python, and pyyaml are installed. 
      The structure of this library is important to the usability of the library. To maximize simplicity and usability of the Aerolyzer library, the semantics of the python init file need to make it clear where each function is from. Aerolyzer is designed such that “import aerolyzer” will be the needed import to access the aerolyzer functions later on in the code by calling “aerolyzer.<function-name>()”.
			In the Aerolyzer package, \_\_init\_\_.py is a python file that determines how a module is imported. Aerolyzer’s \_\_init\_\_.py contains imports of the python scripts that supply Aerolyzer functionality. Setup.py is a python file that determines which packages will be installed when downloading the Aerolyzer module. The code for these files can be seen here.
            \_\_init\_\_.py
            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
            version = "0.0.0.4"
            import image_restriction_functions
            import image_restriction_main
            import retrieve_image_data
            from wunderData import *
            from horizon import *
			\end{lstlisting}
            setup.py (The line that sets the required packages)
            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]

            _requirements = ['exifread', 'numpy>=1.8.0', 'opencv-python', 'pyyaml',]

            \end{lstlisting}
          \paragraph{Design Relationships}
          When importing Aerolyzer, the \_\_init\_\_.py script executes and imports all python scripts with Aerolyzer functionality, including wunderground data script, image restriction script, image analysis script, etc.
          \paragraph{Design Constraints}
          The setup script for importing Aerolyzer is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 and is constrained to the compliance of said licence. 
      \subsubsection{Design overlays}
      		The Aerolyzer library is Under the Apache Licence Version 2.0 and follows Apaches permissions and limitations.
      \subsubsection{Design rationale}
      		The choice to use python’s package index is to keep the Aerolyzer library open source enabling software developers, data analysts, etc. to access the Aerolyzer library and use its image analyzing software for their own research needs. 
      \subsubsection{Design languages}
      The language used will be python 2.7.12 to write a setup script for when importing Aerolyzer.
