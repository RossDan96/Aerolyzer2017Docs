\begin{abstract} 
Atmospheric aerosols are tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere. These particles originate from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions, and unnatural sources such the combustion of fossil fuels. One can visibly see the effects of aerosols in their Rayleigh scattering of sunlight which visibly reddens sunsets and sunrises. Monitoring aerosols is important because high concentrations directly or indirectly impact the atmosphere's chemical composition and radiation distribution. Unfortunately, aerosols in the atmosphere are constantly changing, and current tools such as satellite, aircraft, and ground-based instruments do not compile data easily understandable by the average person. Currently, there is no way to judge local air quality using regional aerosol data without in-depth atmospheric knowledge. Additionally, delayed or inaccurate atmospheric reports complicate getting reliable local atmospheric information.

\section{Problem Definition}
The Aerolyzer project aims to provide an estimate of local air quality based on regional weather data and aerosol analysis to users in the United States. Since aerosol exposure can have adverse health effects, like increased liklihood for bronchial infection, our identification of aerosols will be a big indication of air quality. This can be accomplished by crowd-sourcing cell phone images of the horizon, sunsets, and sunrises into a central database for analysis. The primary objective of this project is to create a python library that extracts location data from images and analyzes said images for aerosol content. The secondary goal of the Aerolyzer project is to develop an application that collects images from users and delivers the python library in an intuitive web-based UI. 

\section{Proposed Solution}
The Aerolyzer web application has been partially developed and will be expanded to present two options to the user: contribute to the Aerolyzer project by uploading their image of the horizon, or look up local air quality by zip code. The Aerolyzer project will only serve users in the United States. The Aerolyzer server-sided python library shall use a classification algorithm to filter out images that do not contain the horizon during sunrises or sunsets. Acceptable images shall be stored and categorized in a database for analysis. The library shall be able to perform an analysis on relevant images in its database based on date, location, and 3rd party APIs. The library shall be able to identify sunrises, sunsets, the horizon, and atmospheric phenomena within degrees of certainty.

\section{Performance Metrics} 
When completed, this library shall identify horizons in a test-selection of images with a minimum accuracy of 66\%. Of pictures that have had horizons identified, sunsets and sunrises will be identified with a minimum of 50\% certainty. This certainty shall also be verifiable through a series of regression tests to prove the accuracy of horizon detection. The library will be able to provide general weather data amassed from public API regardless of whether the user provides an image or their zip code. The library will be perform color analysis on user unout images that have been classified as sunrises or sunsets. Based on this color analysis, the application will display the aerosol that most likely caused the scattering of different hues. To standardize future development, a development environment shall be created.
